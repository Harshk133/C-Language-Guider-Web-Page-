                    <p>C is a programming language developed at AT & T's Bell Laboratories of USA in 1972.</p>
                    <p>It was designed and written by <i>Dennis Ritchie.</i></p>
                    <p>Initially C language was created for a specific purpose, that was to design the UNIX operating
                        system. In the late seventies C began to replace the more familiar language of that time like
                        PL/I, ALGOL etc. Although it is a general-purpose programming language, its compact syntax and
                        efficient execution characterisitics have made it a system programming language. </p>
                    <p>The C language is so named because is predecessor was called B. The B language was developed by
                        <i>Ken Thompson</i> of Bell Labs. </p>
                    <p>C is a general-purpose programming language, it has been closely associated with system
                        programming activities. It was first used to write the kernal of the UNIX operating system and
                        has been closely tied to UNIX implementations. </p>
                    <p>Today C is most of <u>popular</u>, <u>structured</u>, <u>high-level</u>, <u>machine independent
                            language</u>. Major developments in C took place in the period of 1972 to 1983.</p>

                            <p>The ALGOL (ALGOrithm Oriented Language) is the root of all modern languages. It was
                                introduced in 1960. ALGOL is a structured programming language used for system
                                programming. </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>In 1967, Martin Richards developed a language called BCPL (Basic Combined Programming
                                Language) primarily for writing system software. In 1970, Ken Thompson created a
                                language using many features of BCPL and called it simply B. B was used to create early
                                versions of UNIX at Bell Laboratories. Both BCPL and B were system programming
                                languages. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>C was evolved from ALGOL, BCPL and B by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972
                                with concept of datatypes and new features. It was developed along with UNIX operating
                                system. During these days C language is very popular in educational, commercial use.</p>

                            <p>During 1970s, C had evolved into say that <q>Traditional C</q>. Traditional C became more
                                popular after publication of the book, <q><i>The C Programmign Language</i></q> by Brian
                                Kerninghan and Dennis Ritchie in 1978. This language popularly called as <i>K&R C</i>

                        <li>
                            <p>There were continuous efforts to improve the power and scope by incorporating new
                                features in C. The standadization committee of C has added few features of C++/Java in
                                1999. This version usually referred to as C99.</p>
