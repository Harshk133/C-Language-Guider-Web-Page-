                    <p>C is a programming language developed at AT & T's Bell Laboratories of USA in 1972.</p>
                    <p>It was designed and written by <i>Dennis Ritchie.</i></p>
                    <p>Initially C language was created for a specific purpose, that was to design the UNIX operating system. In the late seventies C began to replace the more familiar language of that time like PL/I, ALGOL etc. Although it is a general-purpose programming language, its compact syntax and efficient execution characterisitics have made it a system programming language. </p>
                    <p>The C language is so named because is predecessor was called B. The B language was developed by <i>Ken Thompson</i> of Bell Labs. </p>
                    <p>C is a general-purpose programming language, it has been closely associated with system programming activities. It was first used to write the kernal of the UNIX operating system and has been closely tied to UNIX implementations. </p>
                    <p>Today C is most of <u>popular</u>, <u>structured</u>, <u>high-level</u>, <u>machine independent language</u>. Major developments in C took place in the period of 1972 to 1983.</p>
